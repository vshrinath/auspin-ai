## The 4 systematic failures that kill AI pilots:

### 1. Leadership misalignment

Ambition without shared reality leads to misaligned expectations

### 2. Governance gaps

Risk, policy, and reputation exposure create insurmountable barriers

### 3. Messy integration

Brittle data plumbing and legacy workflows break under pressure

### 4. Unscalable economics

Unclear ROI and rising cost-to-serve make scaling impossible

**Bottom line:** We exist to fix these four—systematically.
